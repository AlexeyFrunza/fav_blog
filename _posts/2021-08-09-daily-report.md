Hey ! Today I have 4 lectures in college and it will be challenge for me . This morning I helped my friend Denis to set up blog on Jekyll and run it with *GitHub Pages* . Then I got back to Ruby on Rails course, trying to fix my console error . At first, I found a couple of mistakes and it started to work , but a few steps later I got the same error . 

![rails error](assets/img/rails_console_error.png "Rails")

Most likely I did syntatic mistake somewhere but can't find it , will get back to it tonight. 
Bye!
