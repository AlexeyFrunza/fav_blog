# It's nice to remember .

Today we had 4 lectures . 2 from them was system programming . It was a teacher we don't know, but she is a good person . At first lecture we remembered C# basics in slide-show format , then we got practice in a different audience . Our teacher gave us exercises to build console apps . I did everything without much effort and it feels good . I had remembered school curriculum and some basic C# methods . In general, it was funny day .
 
Bye!
