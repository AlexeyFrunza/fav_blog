### Face to face with Web Programming

Tomorrow I have 2 classes on the *Web Programming* subject . It will be interesting .  I think , nothing is better than getting classes on subject that you like . I already know the teacher , but he has not yet conducted classes with us . As for Ruby on Rails ... I still have not solving the problem . I looked up all the commits . Just a little more and I will copy all his code from repository . But I still have a hope that I'll look this mistake up . 

Bye!
