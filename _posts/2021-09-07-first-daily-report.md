Hey ! Here is my humble achivements list for today :

1) Helped my friend to:
- understand git commands such as:

`git add` , `git commit` , `git push` , `git branch`  ,

`git merge ` , `git status` , `git checkout` 

- get up with jekyll without customizing so far

2) Customized my blog on Jekyll using Lagrange theme

See you!
